"""python-pptx helpers for filling an existing branded deck.

The deck is authored in PowerPoint and shipped as a .pptx; the tool opens it and replaces the
bracketed `[placeholder]` tokens, repopulates the native charts and tables, clones the slides that
repeat per intervention, and drops the slides that don't apply. Nothing is drawn from scratch, so the
master, theme, fonts and branding survive untouched.

python-pptx has no slide-copy or slide-delete API, and no run-safe text replacement — those are the
three things this module provides. The recurring hazard is relationship IDs: a cloned slide's XML
still references the SOURCE part's rIds, so every image/chart reference has to be re-registered
against the new slide part or PowerPoint reports the file as corrupt.
